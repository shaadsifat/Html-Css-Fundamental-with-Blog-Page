      All modern websites and web applications are built using three
      <em>fundamental</em>
      technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are known as the languages
      of the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this article, we'll focus on HTML. Letâ€™s explore what HTML is and why
      itâ€™s a great idea for you to learn it.
    </p>
    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
      <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. Itâ€™s a markup language
      â€” not a programming language â€” that web developers use to structure and
      define the content of web pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML is made up of elements that describe different types of content, such
      as: paragraphs, links, headings, images & videos. Web browsers read and
      interpret HTML code to display websites as we see them.
    </p>
    <p>Each HTML element generally includes three main parts:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The opening tag</li>
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The content or actual element</li>
    </ol>

      <li>To impress your friends ðŸ˜Ž</li>
